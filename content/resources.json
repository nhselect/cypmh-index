It is designed to ensure that all medical students and foundation doctors are trained to understand, identify and respond appropriately when faced with a patient with a possible eating disorder. It is the result of collaboration between eating disorder charity Beat, Health Education England and the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Faculty of Eating Disorders. Dedicated to the memory of Averil Hart and everyone else who has died unnecessarily from an eating disorder, it is our hope that this will be a significant step to ensuring that avoidable deaths from eating disorders are consigned to the past. \nThis training programme is designed to enable doctors to: \n• Identify the major eating disorders and spot the early warning signs \n• Understand the role of starvation in eating disorders and the effects on the brain \n• Understand common challenges experienced by clinicians identifying people with eating disorders \n• Identify the occurrence of eating disorders in patients who may present with other conditions \n• Understand how to assess for an eating disorder \n• Understand from sufferers of EDs, how they confronted their illness \n• Recognise the official guidance and care pathways available \nModule 1 is aimed at medical students, and is a necessary requirement before completing Module 2, aimed at foundation doctors. Both modules include a number of additional resources for those looking to further their understanding of eating disorders.","format":"Interactive","content":"E-learning module","upload_date":"2022-03-18","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/751213","keywords":["eating disorder"],"duration":60.0,"slug":"_576","attribution":"Eating disorder training for medical students, trainees and doctors programme (elfh)","starred":false,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":false,"certifiable":true},{"id":516,"title":"Patient rights","description":"This session will describe how everyone, regardless of health condition or impairment, has a right to respect, dignity and opportunity and will explore how these rights are enshrined in national and international law.","format":"Interactive","content":"E-learning module","upload_date":"2022-02-22","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/747510","keywords":["health inequality","health equality"],"duration":20.0,"slug":"_516","attribution":"Disability Matters","starred":false,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":true,"certifiable":true},{"id":513,"title":"Communication matters in health","description":"This session looks at how to communicate effectively with disabled children and young people in and about their learning, in educational settings and beyond.","format":"Interactive","content":"E-learning module","upload_date":"2022-02-22","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/747271","keywords":["reasonable adjustments"],"duration":35.0,"slug":"_513","attribution":"Disability Matters","starred":false,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":true,"certifiable":true},{"id":433,"title":"Liberty Protection Safeguards","description":"Information regarding drivers and context for the introduction of Liberty Protection Safeguards.
