It is the result of collaboration between eating disorder charity Beat, Health Education England and the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Faculty of Eating Disorders. Dedicated to the memory of Averil Hart and everyone else who has died unnecessarily from an eating disorder, it is our hope that this will be a significant step to ensuring that avoidable deaths from eating disorders are consigned to the past. \nThis training programme is designed to enable doctors to: \n•\tIdentify the major eating disorders and spot the early warning signs \n•\tUnderstand the role of starvation in eating disorders and the effects on the brain \n•\tUnderstand common challenges experienced by clinicians identifying people with eating disorders \n•\tIdentify the occurrence of eating disorders in patients who may present with other conditions \n•\tUnderstand how to assess for an eating disorder \n•\tUnderstand from sufferers of EDs, how they confronted their illness \n•\tRecognise the official guidance and care pathways available \nModule 1 is aimed at medical students, and is a necessary requirement before completing Module 2, aimed at foundation doctors. Both modules include a number of additional resources for those looking to further their understanding of eating disorders.","format":"Interactive","content":"E-learning module","upload_date":"2022-03-18","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/696295","keywords":["eating disorder"],"duration":60.0,"slug":"_576","folder":"Mental Health:Common Mental Health Disorders:Eating Disorders:Further Resources","starred":false,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":false,"certifiable":true},{"id":494,"title":"A report on the mental health of children and adolescents with a learning disability in Britain","description":"This report, based on the experiences of over 18,000 children aged between 5 and 15 years old found that one in three (33 per cent) children with a learning disability are likely to have a mother with mental health needs and nearly half are living in poverty (47 per cent)","format":"Text","content":"Report","upload_date":"2022-02-22","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/747540","keywords":[],"duration":40.0,"slug":"_494","folder":"Learning Disability and Autism:Physical and Mental Health:Mental Health and Learning Disability:Further Resources","starred":null,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":false,"certifiable":null},{"id":579,"title":"Mental Capacity Act and Young People aged 16 or 17","description":"This session outlines the Mental Capacity Act and how it is applied to people aged 16 or 17.","format":"Website","content":"E-learning module","upload_date":"2022-03-18","url":"https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/749857","keywords":["mental capacity act","MCA"],"duration":30.0,"slug":"_579","folder":"Legal:Mental Capacity Act (MCA):Further Resources","starred":false,"easy_read":false,"lived_experience":false,"certifiable":true},{"id":268,"title":"People with a learning disability die avoidably every year - do you know how many?
