      These are some resources that are great to share with the young
      person or their family. Healthcare professionals will find them useful as they give an insight into the understanding required by the CYP and family and they may also help address questions that might be posed to the healthcare
      professional.

This list takes the user on a natural patient journey from understanding why CYP self-harm and how to assess these behaviours against best practice guidance. The resources then allow the user to expand their knowledge in the areas of self-harm risk, care pathways, management of self-harm and care on the ward, communication with the CYP and alternatives and distractions to self-harm.
